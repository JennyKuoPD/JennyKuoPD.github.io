                <p class="body-1">Develop a new 7.8-inch e-reader based on the previous generation that can be used on two models - black and white and color panels - to provide customers with an open reading experience that is easy to read and take notes. Our goal is to secure a place in the market among numerous competing products.</p>

                <h1 class="Objective">02 | Role &amp; Deliverables</h1>
                <p class="body-1">I served as the project&#39;s software PM and product designer, working closely with 9 software engineers. Throughout the project, my responsibilities included market analysis, product positioning, design proposals, feature planning, interface design, internal testing, and development validation. After launch, I led the optimization of the product with another designer.</p>

                <p class="body-1">The use of different panels for the two models presented unique characteristics and requirements, which required different functionalities and planning. However, they had to operate under the same system, testing the designer&#39;s ability to plan for shared use. Discussions with the software team were necessary to determine the feasibility of execution and how to split the workload. In addition, the team had to prioritize the development of all features and ensure that the product&#39;s size did not compromise its usability. Communication with cross-functional teams allowed me to learn how to optimize human resources, time, and cost to maximize the product&#39;s benefits and ensure a timely launch.</p>

                <p class="body-1">The black and white version of the product was successfully launched on the US official website on January 19, 2023, with the color version following on March 15 of the same year. The product is currently being marketed and sold in the market.</p>

<p>Mobiscribe is a US brand that specializes in designing and manufacturing e-paper products in Taiwan. The Wave is a 7.8-inch E-Ink e-reader available in two versions - B&amp;W and Color.</p>
<p><img src="/reader/img/logo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The B&amp;W version features a 300 PPI display, while the Color version has a 100 PPI display. Both displays have a resolution of 1404 x 1872 pixels and come with a stylus pen for note-taking and drawing. The Wave runs on the latest open-source Android12 operating system, which allows users to access the Google Play store for a wide variety of apps. This means users are no longer limited by the restrictions of a proprietary bookstore. In response to the growing trend of audiobook consumption, the Wave also features built-in speakers for audio playback.</p>

<h3 id="e-ink-color">E-ink Color</h3>
<p>Understanding the technology and limitations of e-ink is crucial for designing this product. It is necessary to study which colors and design elements can achieve the best effect in this display technology. In the design decision-making meeting, it was decided to use #00FFFF as the primary color and #FFFF00 as the secondary color, as these two colors have good readability and contrast on e-ink displays. Using the same color tone to design illustrations and drawings ensures consistency in the overall design style.</p>
<h3 id="icon">Icon</h3>
<p>As the system architecture was vast, only a portion of the icon designs will be presented here.</p>
<p><img src="/reader/img/system2.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="cover-design">Cover design</h3>
<p>When designing the power on/off, standby and other system pages, I considered the original concept of the brand which was to provide a fast and easy-to-use handwriting experience on mobile devices. I proposed different styles, but ultimately we decided to use a one-stroke painting style to express this concept. We wanted users to feel the smoothness of handwriting while taking notes and reading. The power-on screen was designed to provide a pleasant reading experience, while the power-off screen was meant to encourage users to start writing by resonating with the brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;S&rdquo; logo. The standby screen was designed to convey the feeling of setting sail and venturing into the sea of reading again.</p>

<p>The illustration continues the hand-drawn style of 6.8, using a continuous one-line technique to express the concept of a never-ending wave. Color e-readers only started appearing in 2022, so users can finally enjoy a colorful visual experience on their e-readers. We hope that users can fully indulge in reading on Wave.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s showcase the empty state of each app when there is no content. Then, we&rsquo;ll go back to the process and experience of creating the first notebook in Note. Users can choose a cover or upload their own style to create a personalized notebook. Once completed, we will display the state of each app when it contains content.</p>

<h1 id="design-reflection">Design Reflection</h1>
<p>In the design process, it is important to discuss and evaluate each design decision based on effective information and feasibility assessments through UX research and reporting. Making decisions of all sizes and adjusting designs during execution by explaining, evaluating functionality, assessing feasibility, and designing are all important steps towards achieving the desired design.</p>
<p>However, in situations where time and resources are limited, it is necessary to adjust the priority of design or explore different design options to find a more effective solution. It is important to consider how to make adjustments to achieve the same effect. Additionally, communication and collaboration with the team, and listening to opinions and suggestions from different departments are also crucial. In this project, I found that I needed to be flexible and make quick adjustments to make the most appropriate decisions in order to achieve the design goal.</p>
