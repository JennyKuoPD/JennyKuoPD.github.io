testimonial: "We are a strength and conditioning institute that specializes in training elite athletes. As such, we need to keep track of the smallest changes in their physical abilities. We developed a system called a PRO score which is a battery of tests for this need. The theory was sound but it took us forever to administer the tests. The prototype that Alexis designed will be able to help us automate these tests and shrink testing time by half. He was able to listen to our needs and address it directly. I'm confident that when the final product comes in, it will help us a great deal in terms of our operations."

# Background

The company sells health check programs from major hospitals and observes that existing users are health-conscious groups, so it develops habit-building services. The difference from other competing products is that we preset 6 items, namely diet, lifestyle, water intake, sleep, exercise, others, and hope to help users maintain health.



# Competitive Analysis

Observing the processes and mechanisms of other products, we converge on the demand to move towards a healthy direction. Most of the presets are healthy habits, but if users have other needs, they can also establish various habits by themselves to help life.

# Product target

After receiving the product outline given by the PM, for product planning and implementation, four main directions have been set: nutrition advice, preset system habits, community sharing, learning process, and other habits can be customized. The remote goal is to be able to See community friends and play ranked matches.

### 01 Pre-use quiz
Whether disease control or health management is required, it can help the system to tailor habit recommendations for users.

You can tick to confirm when you have done things every day. If you haven't ticked in the past, you can't tick again. I hope to help users record the process of forming a habit.

### 02 Complete the habit every day and punch in!

According to the pre-test meeting, three different types of habits are suggested, and the quantity and content can also be adjusted. If the check is completed on the day, the check-in cannot be made in the past. In order to encourage users to complete the habits and accumulate achievements, the rewards in the gamification mechanism are used. Different levels and medals are designed.

By sorting, you can adjust the customary order of the check-in page. There will be six preset types of new habits, and there are health items recommended by the system.
