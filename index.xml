      <description>Background The company focuses on health and has developed telemedicine-related businesses before the outbreak of Covid-19. It provides diverse online consultation services with doctors, including text-based and video-based consultations. Text-based consultation requires users to input text and upload images, and doctors will reply within 48 hours. The disadvantage is that the waiting time is too long. Video-based consultation is a high-priced service. Therefore, the company wanted to find a solution that could meet in the middle and came up with a telephone consultation mode.</description>
